after analyzing the data, I found some data that would help StayHealthy with their marketing strategy
1. their target audience have an office job, meaning that they spend an awful lot of time sitting down but are indeed active at lunchtime and after 5PM
2. their customers do some light activity

To sum up the recommendations for the app

1. add a notification to remind the user to reach a step goal, 10000 steps if no physical activity is done, 7000 is a good average even if the WHO and CDC say that 5000 is the absolute minimum
2. in order to lose weight, you need to be in calorie deficit, so the app can track the macros like myfitnesspal and give an alert as soon as a goal is reached whether it be protein, carbs or fat
3. add a notification for the user to go to sleep
4. the app could also give an alert after work around 5PM to motivate the user to go to the gym and not give in to the lack of motivation
5. in order to improve the user's sleep, the app could also provide a white noise service in order to help with the sleeping process. Sounds that could be included: warp, rain, zen music
